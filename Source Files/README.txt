Difficulties:

For some reason, the scriptable objects I was using would constantly lose
their associated data, so I added safegaurds to repopulate any lost data.
This was mainly with the CSV string, which I thought was a useful way to
export or share the level data.

Buttons. I know that buttons are not the best way to implement a level design
tool, but I couldn't think of another way to work it. I wanted to be able to
right-click to remove tiles, but instead have to have a blank one that had to
be placed down like regular tiles. I would love to make this tool better over
time and could see myself using it for a simple project or recreating Baba is
You as a passtime project!


Notes:

This was by far my favorite project out of both Scripting 1 and 2. Developing
tools for designers or just to make something easier is something that I did
on the side, but as a main element I could see myself taking a job making tools
for development inside of Unity.

I think at some point I will tackle an advanced Dialogue system such as

or a music system / audio event system similar to the one on your channel

Also, I know that you might have looked at the overall folder as late,
but I would like to plead that it was purely because I had demo videos as
well that I thought should be included as part of this project.

I had a lot of fun making this and working with 2D grid based levels / sprites, and one
of the demos showcases the Sprite Animations, which otherwise was forgotten
in the main walkthrough video. I hope you understand, thank you.

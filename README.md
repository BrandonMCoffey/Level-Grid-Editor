This is a level designer tool for 2D games that makes creating and storing grid-tile based maps
easy. The tool comprises of a Object Designer and a Level Designer.
Note: The below demonstration files use assets from a game called Baba Is You. These sprites are not included in the project 

The Object Designer GUI

The object designer allows the user to create 'objects' that will be used in the level designer. The reason for using this is to give objects multiple sprites, whether
it is animated and whether it is directional (seperate sprites for each direction it can face).

The Level Designer GUI

The level designer allows the user to take the objects they have created and input them into a grid-based level. This level can be referenced and generated in game.
